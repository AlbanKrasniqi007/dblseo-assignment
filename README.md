## ✅ What We’re Looking For

We want to see how you **think, structure, and execute** independently. This is not a step-by-step tutorial — treat it like a real-world project. Your deliverable should demonstrate:

- Clean, responsive design (**mobile-first**)  
- Solid **on-page SEO** implementation  
- Clear **page structure and content hierarchy**  
- **Fast performance** and optimized assets  
- Clean, organized, and readable **codebase**  
- **Reusable components** (if applicable)  
- Basic **internal linking** and navigation

## 📄 Required Pages

Please include the following pages in your project:

- `Home`  
- At least **2 individual service pages**  
- `About`  
- `Contact` (form can be a placeholder)  
- Custom `404` page  

---

## 🧠 Key Considerations

- Treat this like a **real-world client deliverable**  
- Follow **SEO best practices**:
  - Unique and relevant `<title>` and `<meta description>` per page  
  - Proper **semantic HTML**  
  - Clear heading structure (H1, H2, etc.)  
  - Structured content and **internal links**  
- Placeholder content is fine — just keep it **realistic and relevant**  
- Make your own decisions on structure, styling, and content strategy  

---

## 📦 Deliverables

Please submit the following:

- A **GitHub repository** with your full code  
- A `README.md` file that includes:
  - A short description of your approach  
  - Any assumptions, notes, or limitations  
  - (Optional) A **live deployment** link (e.g. Vercel, Netlify)
